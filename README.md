# pylspd
A python implementation of a "long strings probabilistic dictionaries"
This module provides two kind of dictionaries optimized to work with *very* long string keys

A LSPD can be created with a set of hasher functions so as when you define a key, the concatenation of all the hashes of that key is stored

A LSPSSDD is like a LSPD but if the key is shorter than the one generated by the hashers, the original key is stored. Hence it is deterministic for short keys.

Usage:

```python
d = LSPSSDD(hashers=None) #By default it uses (md5, sha1, sha224, sha256, sha384, sha512) from hashlib
d["a"] = 23
d["what a string"*100000] = 54
print d["a"]
print "what a string"*100000 in d

```
